# nuox_project

I have successfully completed a Learning App.Using this application we can purchase online courses.As a self taught flutter developer it was very challenging at the initial stage and faced many problems, spend every day and night for for clearing those errors and exceptions.One of the greatest challenge is integrating the App with server.Because I didn’t have a complete knowledge about Rest APIs and done lot of mistakes at the initial stage.But I learned more from those mistakes and completed the application successfully.
